This project explores the use of logistic regression for binary classification. The specific task is to predict passenger survival on the ill-fated voyage of the RMS Titanic. By analyzing a dataset containing passenger information like age, gender, and travel class, the project aims to build a model that can classify passengers into "survived" or "perished."

The project walks you through the essential steps of building and evaluating a machine learning model for binary classification:

1. **Data Preparation:**
    - Loading the dataset.
    - Addressing missing values.
    - Selecting relevant features.
    - Preprocessing features (one-hot encoding, handling missing values).
    - Splitting data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Building and Evaluation:**
    - Choosing logistic regression as the classification algorithm.
    - Training the model on the prepared training data.
    - Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, cross-validation, confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision, recall, sensitivity, and specificity.

3. **Model Usage:**
    - Demonstrating how to make predictions on new, unseen data points.
    - Calculating the probability of survival for a new passenger.

This project provides a practical introduction to logistic regression for binary classification tasks. It can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about machine learning for classification problems.
